# E-commerce Data Analysis

This repository contains data analysis projects focused on exploring and analyzing e-commerce datasets. It includes multiple datasets and code developed as part of coursework at the University of Stirling.

## Overview

The projects included here aim to conduct thorough data analysis on e-commerce datasets. Leveraging data science techniques, we explore patterns, trends, and insights to gain a deeper understanding of the data and extract valuable information.
